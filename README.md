# 🤖 Machine Learning System for Sales Series Forecasting

Data Analysis and Visualization Approach

Developed as a major academic project in collaboration with team members Khushi and Vidhi at Delhi Technical Campus, this project implements a robust Machine Learning system to forecast sales time series using data-driven strategies and rich visual analytics.

📌 Project Overview
This system is designed to help businesses make smarter decisions by predicting future sales based on historical data. It combines:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📈 Data Visualization

🤖 Machine Learning Forecasting Models

🌐 Web-based UI using Flask

🎯 Objectives
Understand sales trends, customer behavior, and seasonality

Build accurate forecasting models to optimize inventory and resource planning

Enable real-time interaction through a web interface

📌 Key Outcomes:

+ Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most accurate and reliable model based on performance metrics like Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Max Error.

+ Our ML-based system successfully identified key factors influencing sales, including product type, outlet type, MRP, and visibility.

+ Data visualization empowered stakeholders to easily interpret sales patterns and make data-driven decisions.

+ This project demonstrates that ML-driven sales forecasting systems can significantly improve forecasting accuracy and assist in strategic business planning.



📌 **Conclusion**


We built a Machine Learning system to forecast sales using models like
    + Decision Tree
    + Linear Regression, and 
    + Random Forest. Among them, 
    Random Forest performed best based on accuracy and MAE. **This project helped us identify key factors affecting sales and make predictions that support better business planning.**
